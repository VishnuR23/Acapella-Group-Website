        <h1>About Us!</h1>
        <p>We're an all-inclusive lower-voices a cappella group known for our fun performances and original music!
          In the year 2000, a rag-tag group of brave souls banded together to accomplish something great that would change the world as we knew it. But they failed. So they did the next best thing. Since then, Noteworthy has been serenading the people of UC Berkeley and beyond with sonic styles across all genres and all levels of comedy. Along the way, we have endured episodes of accidental bank robbery,
          rogue capitalistic holiday mascots, and rediscovering the power of friendship every semester because the plot demands it. Through this emerged Berkeley's "brightest a cappella group on campus!‚Äù Our legal team told us to put that in quotes.</p>
