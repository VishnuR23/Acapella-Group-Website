# React + Vite

Utilized React + Vite to create a commissioned website for an Acappella Group at UC Berkeley. The website itself features a slew of different features including an interactive video wheel, routing to different webpages, a popup page featuring character profiles and more! 

This project ultimately highlights a ton of different basic and complex skills within React, including design utiling CSS and HTML as well as backend functionality with JAVASCRIPT.
